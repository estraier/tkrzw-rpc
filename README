Tkrzw-RPC is available on UNIX-like systems (Linux, Mac OS etc).
On Unix-like systems, GCC 7.3 or later version is required to build
the library.  GNU make and other standard tools are also required.
You should install the latest version of Tkrzw to make sure the
compatibility.
Then, run these commands.  The files are installed under "/usr/local".

  ./configure --enable-opt-native
  make
  sudo make install

On FreeBSD tkrzw-rpc compiles and runs on LLVM, even tough it has not 
been extensively tested. Like many *BSD platforms on FreeBSD "make" 
defaults to bsdmake, so you might need to replace "make" with 
"gmake" in the above instructions.
Finally, you will need to install the following ports/packages 
before compiling tkrzw-rpc:
devel/protobuf, devel/protobuf-c, devel/abseil, devel/grpc.

Thanks.
