Tkrzw-RPC is available on UNIX-like systems (Linux, Mac OS, FreeBSD, Solaris,
and etc).  On Unix-like systems, GCC 7.3 or later version is required to build
the library.  You can also use CLang, whose command interface is compatible
with GCC.  GNU make and other standard tools are also required.  GNU make and
other standard tools are also required.  You should install the latest version
of Tkrzw to make sure the compatibility.  Tkrzw-RPC depends on gRPC and Protocol
Buffers.  You might need to install the following packages before compiling
Tkrzw-RPC: devel/protobuf, devel/protobuf-c, devel/abseil, devel/grpc.

Then, run these commands.  The files are installed under "/usr/local".

  ./configure --enable-opt-native
  make
  sudo make install

On some UNIX-like systems including FreeBSD and Solaris, "make" defaults to
bsdmake or other non-GNU make, so you might need to replace "make" with
"gmake" in the above instructions.

Thanks.
